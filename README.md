Pathfinder Game Manager
=======================

Dear Reader,

This is a simple Flask app to keep track of players, characters and experience points for the
<a hlink="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/">Pathfinder Role Playing Game</a>. This is also an excuse to learn
more about Flask, Gihub ticketing and using Github for product management.  Should be fun.
 Maybe a log of the game as well.


Feel free to copy anything here, it may not work.
